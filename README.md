# Raspberry Pi Shell Scripts

This project contains a list with shell scripts used for automated installations of my own Raspberry Pi.

The easy way to get the files of this project is cloning it using Git. By the way, you can download the install script and run it using:./install.sh

All these scripts are agrupated in separate directories. Inside these directories the README file explains how to use it individually.
